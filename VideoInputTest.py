                    Shot Location (SL): Based on the player's position on the court, categorize the shot location from the following list:
                    Right corner/Right baseline
                    Left corner/Left baseline
                    Right wing

                    Other (if none of the above apply)
                    Shot Type (ST): Determine if the shot is a 'Jumpshot' or a 'Layup'.
                    Time Stamp of Shot (TS): Identify the exact timestamp of the shot, formatted as HH:MM:SS.
                    Make/Miss (MM): Analyze the position of the ball relative to the hoop, the player's follow-through, and the surrounding context (e.g., net movement) to determine the outcome. Conclude whether the shot is a 'Make' or a 'Miss'. If the outcome is not determinable, state 'Undetermined'.
