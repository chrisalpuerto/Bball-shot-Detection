# Bball-shot-Detection

In this program I am working on a Machine Learning project that will use a live camera to detect how many made / missed shots a person has shot on the basketball court.

So far I have basketball and hoop detection models. To test these models out: 

1. pip install requiremenets.txt
2. Inside CamTest.py, edit:
'''
annotated_frame = 
'''
to either hoop_results.plot() for hoop detection or ball_results.plot() for ball detection

3. run CamTest.py
